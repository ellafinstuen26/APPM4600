What does the method do?
The method splits up intervals until it finds the root. 

What is required for the method to work?
Must be an odd numbered polynomial with interval that contains no more than one root and f(x) in the interval crosses the x axis. 

What problem is the fixed point iteration trying to solve?
Fixed point iteration is trying to solve for a points of f(x) that lie on  y=x. Using this for root finding changes the method so that it finds points of f(x) that lie on the x axis.

4 Exercises
1. Consider the function f (x) = x2(x − 1) and use bisection with the following starting intervals.
(a) (a, b) = (0.5, 2)

the approximate root is 0.9999999701976776
the error message reads: 0
f(astar) = -2.98023206113385e-08


(b) (a, b) = (−1, 0.5)

the approximate root is -1
the error message reads: 1
f(astar) = -2

This one is unsuccessful because f(x) does not cross the y axis in this interval

(c) (a, b) = (−1, 2)

the approximate root is 0.9999999701976776
the error message reads: 0
f(astar) = -2.98023206113385e-08

I don't think bisection would get to exactly zero but would get within the tolerance of it. 


2. Apply bisection to some functions listed below. You should set your desired accuracy to ε =
10−5.
(a) f (x) = (x − 1)(x − 3)(x − 5) with a = 0 and b = 2.4.

the approximate root is 1.0000030517578122
the error message reads: 0
f(astar) = 2.4414006618542327e-05

(b) f (x) = (x − 1)2(x − 3) with a = 0 and b = 2.

the approximate root is 0
the error message reads: 1
f(astar) = -3

(c) f (x) = sin(x) with a = 0, b = 0.1. What about a = 0.5 and b = 3π
4

the approximate root is 0
the error message reads: 0
f(astar) = 0.0

the approximate root is 0.5
the error message reads: 1
f(astar) = 0.479425538604203


This behavior is what I would expect. The code was successful in finding accurate roots to the desired amount of digits(5) when given good parameters. Especially for sin(x) first interval it worked perfectly. 


3. Consider the following functions
(a) f (x) = x(1+(7-x**5)/x**2)**3
(b) f (x) = x − (x5−7)/x**2
(c) f (x) = x − (x5−7)/5x4
(d) f (x) = x − (x5−7)/12
• Verify that x = 71/5 is a fixed point for these functions.
It is true that 7**(1/2) is fixed point for these iterations (f(7**(1/2))= 7**(1/2))

• Apply the fixed point iteration with x0 = 1 with a tolerance of 10−10. For which functions
does the fixed point iteration converge? For which functions does it not converge? Try
to come up with an explanation of why the fixed point iteration performs the way it does
for each of the functions.
The functions that the fixed point iteration does converge is function 3. It will converge for function with with a sufficient amount of iterations(500 did not work but 1000 did where as 100 works for c) it does not converge for 1 and 2 because the initial guess is not in the necessary box. It does not For a and b, the function does not stay in the box long enough. For c and d it does stay in the box and there is enough there for it to converge. 

For 1000 iterations function 3 and 4 return:
the approximate fixed point is: 1.475773161594552
f1(xstar): 1.4757731615945522
Error message reads: 0
the approximate fixed point is: 1.4757731616428729
f2(xstar): 1.4757731615473733
Error message reads: 0
